Bix is a mix-in framework for business applications using code
weaving to inject business framework behavior using aspect
oriented programming (AOP) techniques. This allows for a shallow,
rich domain inheritance as opposed to infrastructure inheritance
required by many frameworks.

The eventual goal is to have a framework that supports Domain
Driven Design processes.
