A mix-in framework for business applications using code weaving
to inject business framework behavior using aspect oriented
programming (AOP) techniques. This allows for a shallow,
rich domain inheritance as opposed to infrastructure inheritance
required by many frameworks, such as CSLA.

The eventual goal is to have a framework that supports Domain
Driven Design styles of architecture.
